  ## Description
  JustYou is a web application that combines a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, and user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.

  This platform uses the YouTube API to allow the user to search for videos of their choice, save them to their profile and add notes to each saved video.  This feature can come in handy especially for students and content creators, giving them the capability to add notes to 'how to' videos and tutorials for future use and study sessions.  

  ## Installation
